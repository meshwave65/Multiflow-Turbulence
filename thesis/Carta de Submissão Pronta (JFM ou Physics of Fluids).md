Dear Editor,
Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled
“Turbulence as Multiflux: A Proposed Mechanism Integrating High-Velocity Suppression, Inter-Subflow Friction, and Granular Molecular Drag”
by Diogenes Duarte Sobral for consideration as a Rapid Communication in Journal of Fluid Mechanics.
The paper introduces a novel conceptual framework that reinterprets turbulent flow as the nonlinear interaction of multiple quasi-laminar subflows (Multifluxe Theory). We present:

a clear physical mechanism capable of explaining sustained laminar-like states at arbitrarily high Reynolds numbers,
preliminary yet reproducible numerical evidence of 45–62% skin-friction reduction when transverse subflow interaction is limited,
a critical discussion of current clustering limitations and a concrete validation roadmap using Lagrangian tracking and high-fidelity DNS/LES.

We believe the proposed mechanism, if confirmed, would constitute a paradigm shift in turbulence understanding and control, and therefore merits rapid dissemination.
The manuscript has not been previously published, is not under consideration elsewhere, and all co-authors (currently single author) approve submission.
Suggested referees (independent and knowledgeable):

Prof. Beverley McKeon (Stanford)
Prof. Javier Jiménez (UPM Madrid)
Prof. Philipp Schlatter (KTH)
Prof. Sergio Hoyas (UPV Valencia)

We declare no conflict of interest.
Sincerely,
