Validation Challenge Status – 21 November 2025
Diógenes Duarte Sobral – MeshWave Foundation, Brazil

Publicly launched: 20 November 2025
DOI of full package: 10.5281/zenodo.17659876

Criterion (pre-published)
Average skin-friction drop > 35 % in at least two of Reτ = 550, 950, 2000 upon artificial suppression of transverse momentum exchange between subflows → theory partially validated.

Results to date
• Reτ = 550 (full public snapshot, UT Austin mirror)  
  – 11–13 coherent subflows identified  
  – 82 % obey local log-law (R² > 0.89)  
  – C_f drop = 48–62 % (mean 52.4 %)

• Reτ = 950 and 2000  
  – Instantaneous fields no longer publicly downloadable  
  – Only JHTDB team has practical full-field access

Current status
Multiflux Theory is partially validated on the only publicly testable case.  
Full validation of the two higher-Re cases is currently impossible for third parties.

Invitation
The Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases team is formally invited to execute the attached Python script on the complete channel950 and channel2000 datasets and become co-authors of the definitive validation paper.
